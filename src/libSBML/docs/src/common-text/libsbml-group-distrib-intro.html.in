<p> The libSBML &ldquo;distrib&rdquo; extension implements support for the SBML
Level&nbsp;3 <em>Distributions</em> ("distrib") package.  It can be used
in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 and Version&nbsp;2 documents.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Distributions package (also known as 'distrib') provides an extension to SBML Level 3 that extends MathML to allow draws from distributions, and also provides the ability to annotate model elements with information about the distribution their values were drawn from.

The Distributions package adds support to SBML for sampling from a probability distribution. In particular the following are in scope:
<ul>
<li>Sampling from a univariate continuous distribution</li>
<li>Sampling from a univariate discrete distribution</li>
<li>Specification of descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, standard error, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Authors</h2>

The authors of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Distributions specification are Lucian P Smith, Stuart L Moodie, Frank Bergmann, Colin Gillespie, Sarah Keating, Matthias Kï¿½nig, Chris Myers, Maciej J Swat, Darren Wilkinson, and Michael Hucka.
