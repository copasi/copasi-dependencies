 * @class RenderCurve
 * @brief implementation of the Curve concept from the SBML render extension
 *
 * The curve concept in the SBML render extension is similar to the curves in the SBML layout.
 * Each curve consists of a number of either straight line segments or cubic bezier elements.
 * The two element types can also by mixed in a single curve object.
 *
 * In contrast to layout curves, render curves can not have gaps and the individual coordinates of the 
 * curve elements can be specified as a combination of absolute and relative values.
 *
 * Another difference to layout curves is the fact that render curves can specify decorations to be applied
 * to the start and/or the end of the curve (@see LineEnding).
 *
 * Since RenderCurve is derived from GraphicalPrimitive1D, it inherits all its attributes and methods.
