 * @class LinearGradient
 * @brief Representation of a linear gradient object from the SBML render extension.
 *
 * The concept of a linear gradient is more or or less taken from SVG.
 * A linear gradient is defined by a vector which determines the direction and the length 
 * of the gradient. So for a valid gradient this vector should have a length different from 0.
 * Otherwise all restrictions for the GradientBase class apply. (@see GradientBase)
 *
 * The vector for a linear gradient is defined by a start and an endpoint and each point consists
 * of three absolute-relative value pairs (@see RelAbsVector)
 *
 * For examples of LinearGradients see the render extension specification and/or
 * the SVG specification.
