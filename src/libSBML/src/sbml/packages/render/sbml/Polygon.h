 * @class Polygon
 * @brief class representing a polygon from the SBML render extension
 *
 * The Polygon is very similar to the RenderCurve class. The only difference is that in the 
 * polygon the end point of the last element in the curve segment list is
 * automatically connected to the start point of the first element.
 *
 * Since a polygon is a closed shape and doesn't really have a start or an end, it does not get
 * decorations as the RenderCurve does.
 *
 * So a polygon is always closed and can therefor have a fill style and fill style related attributes.
 * Those attributes are inherited from Polygons base class GraphicalPrimitive2D.
