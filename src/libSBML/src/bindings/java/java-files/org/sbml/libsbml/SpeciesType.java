/** 
 *  A <em>species type</em> in SBML Level 2.
 <p>
 * The term <em>species</em> <em>type</em> refers to reacting entities independent of
 * location.  These include simple ions (e.g., protons, calcium), simple
 * molecules (e.g., glucose, ATP), large molecules (e.g., RNA,
 * polysaccharides, and proteins), and others.
 <p>
 * SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 provide an explicit
 * {@link SpeciesType} class of object to enable {@link Species} objects of the same type
 * to be related together.  {@link SpeciesType} is a conceptual construct; the
 * existence of {@link SpeciesType} objects in a model has no effect on the model's
 * numerical interpretation.  Except for the requirement for uniqueness of
 * species/species type combinations located in compartments, simulators
 * and other numerical analysis software may ignore {@link SpeciesType} definitions
 * and references to them in a model.
 <p>
 * There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
 * species types.  One {@link SpeciesType} object cannot be the subtype of another
 * {@link SpeciesType} object; SBML provides no means of defining such
 * relationships.
 <p>
 * As with other major structures in SBML, {@link SpeciesType} has a mandatory
 * attribute, 'id', used to give the species type an identifier.  The
 * identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax
 * permitted in SBML.  {@link SpeciesType} also has an optional 'name' attribute,
 * of type <code>string.</code>  The 'id' and 'name' must be used according to the
 * guidelines described in the SBML specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in
 * the Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification).
 <p>
 * {@link SpeciesType} was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
 * available in SBML Level&nbsp;1 nor in Level&nbsp;3.

 *   letter .= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
 *   digit  .= '0'..'9'
 *   idChar .= letter | digit | '_'
 *   SId    .= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*
 * </pre>
 <p>
 * The characters <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are used for grouping, the
 * character <code>*</code> 'zero or more times', and the character
 * <code>|</code> indicates logical 'or'.  The equality of SBML identifiers is
 * determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e., comparisons must be
 * performed in a case-sensitive manner.  This applies to all uses of <code>SId</code>, 
 * <code>SIdRef</code>, and derived types.
 <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, the 'id' and 'name' attributes were
 * moved to {@link SBase} directly, instead of being defined individually for many
 * (but not all) objects.  Libsbml has for a long time provided functions

 * The {@link AlgebraicRule} fell into this category as well, though because it 
 * contained neither a 'variable' nor a 'symbol' attribute, getId() would

 * For this reason, four new functions are now provided

 * The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
 * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
 * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
 * component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
 * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
 * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the 'name'
 * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
 * should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
 * language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
 * 'name'.)
 <p>
 * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
 * generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
 * may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
 * take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
 * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
 * meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
 * form of the name attribute value.
 <p>
 * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'id' values, there are no
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This
 * allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.
 <p>
 * Regardless of the level and version of the SBML, these functions allow
 * client applications to use more generalized code in some situations 
 * (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have 
 * names).  If the object in question does not posess a 'name' attribute 
 * according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use,
 * libSBML will not allow the name to be set, nor will it read or 
 * write 'name' attributes for those objects.
