/** 
 *  A user-defined function in an SBML model.
 <p>
 * The {@link FunctionDefinition} structure associates an identifier with a
 * function definition.  This identifier can then be used as the function
 * called in subsequent MathML content elsewhere in an SBML model.
 <p>
 * {@link FunctionDefinition} has one required attribute, 'id', to give the
 * function a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
 * definition can refer to it.  A {@link FunctionDefinition} instance can also have
 * an optional 'name' attribute of type <code>string.</code>  Identifiers and names
 * must be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML
 * specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
 * specification).
 <p>
 * {@link FunctionDefinition} has a 'math' subelement containing a MathML
 * expression defining the function body.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 and SBML
 * Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1, that 'math' subelement is required;
 * in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, this restriction was relaxed,
 * making the 'math' subelement optional.  The content of this element can
 * only be a MathML 'lambda' element.  The 'lambda' element must begin with
 * zero or more 'bvar' elements, followed by any other of the elements in
 * the MathML subset allowed in SBML Level 2 <em>except</em> 'lambda' (i.e., a
 * 'lambda' element cannot contain another 'lambda' element).  This is the
 * only place in SBML where a 'lambda' element can be used.  The function
 * defined by a {@link FunctionDefinition} is only available for use in other
 * MathML elements that <em>follow</em> the {@link FunctionDefinition} definition in the
 * model.  (These restrictions prevent recursive and mutually-recursive
 * functions from being expressed.)
 <p>
 * A further restriction on the content of 'math' is that it cannot contain
 * references to variables other than the variables declared to the
 * 'lambda' itself.  That is, the contents of MathML 'ci' elements inside
 * the body of the 'lambda' can only be the variables declared by its
 * 'bvar' elements, or the identifiers of other {@link FunctionDefinition}
 * instances in the model.  This means must be written so that all
 * variables or parameters used in the MathML content are passed to them
 * via their function parameters.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, this restriction
 * applies also to the MathML <code>csymbol</code> elements for <em>time</em> and 
 * <em>delay</em>; in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it additionally applies to the <code>csymbol</code>
 * element for <em>avogadro</em>.
 <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, if no math element is present in 
 * the {@link FunctionDefinition}, the function has no mathematical meaning 
 * defined in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core. This situation may arise when models 
 * are incomplete, or when additional meanings are provided by an SBML 
 * Level&nbsp;3 package.
 <p>
 * @note Function definitions (also informally known as user-defined
 * functions) were introduced in SBML Level 2.  They have purposefully
 * limited capabilities.  A function cannot reference parameters or other
 * model quantities outside of itself; values must be passed as parameters
 * to the function.  Moreover, recursive and mutually-recursive functions
 * are not permitted.  The purpose of these limitations is to balance power
 * against complexity of implementation.  With the restrictions as they
 * are, function definitions could be implemented as textual
 * substitutions&mdash;they are simply macros.  Software implementations
 * therefore do not need the full function-definition machinery typically
 * associated with programming languages.
 * <br><br>
 * Another important point to note is {@link FunctionDefinition} does not
 * have a separate attribute for defining the units of the value returned
 * by the function.  The units associated with the function's return value,
 * when the function is called from within MathML expressions elsewhere in
 * SBML, are simply the overall units of the expression in
 * {@link FunctionDefinition}'s 'math' subelement when applied to the arguments
 * supplied in the call to the function.  Ascertaining these units requires
 * performing dimensional analysis on the expression.  (Readers may wonder
 * why there is no attribute.  The reason is that having a separate
 * attribute for declaring the units would not only be redundant, but also
 * lead to the potential for having conflicting information.  In the case
 * of a conflict between the declared units and those of the value actually
 * returned by the function, the only logical resolution rule would be to
 * assume that the correct units are those of the expression anyway.)

 <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, the 'id' and 'name' attributes were

/**
   * Unsets the value of the 'name' attribute of this {@link FunctionDefinition}.
   <p>
   * <p>
 * <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, the 'id' and 'name' attributes were
 * moved to {@link SBase} directly, instead of being defined individually for many
 * (but not all) objects.  Libsbml has for a long time provided functions
 * defined on {@link SBase} itself to get, set, and unset those attributes, which 
 * would fail or otherwise return empty strings if executed on any object 
 * for which those attributes were not defined.  Now that all {@link SBase} objects 
 * define those attributes, those functions now succeed for any object with 
 * the appropriate level and version.
 <p>
 * The 'name' attribute is
 * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
 * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
 * label for the component.  The data type of 'name' is the type
 * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
 * restrictions as to the content of 'name' attributes beyond those
 * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
 <p>
 * The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
 * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
 * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
 * component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
 * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
 * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the 'name'
 * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
 * should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
 * language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
 * 'name'.)
 <p>
 * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
 * generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
 * may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
 * take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
 * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
 * meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
 * form of the name attribute value.
 <p>
 * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'id' values, there are no
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This
 * allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.
 <p>
 * Regardless of the level and version of the SBML, these functions allow
 * client applications to use more generalized code in some situations 
 * (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have 
 * names).  If the object in question does not posess a 'name' attribute 
 * according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use,
 * libSBML will not allow the name to be set, nor will it read or 
 * write 'name' attributes for those objects.
