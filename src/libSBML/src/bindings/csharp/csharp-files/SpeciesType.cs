/** 
 * @sbmlpackage{core}
 *
@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html A <em>species type</em> in SBML Level 2.
 *
 * The term @em species @em type refers to reacting entities independent of
 * location.  These include simple ions (e.g., protons, calcium), simple
 * molecules (e.g., glucose, ATP), large molecules (e.g., RNA,
 * polysaccharides, and proteins), and others.
 * 
 * SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 provide an explicit
 * SpeciesType class of object to enable Species objects of the same type
 * to be related together.  SpeciesType is a conceptual construct; the
 * existence of SpeciesType objects in a model has no effect on the model's
 * numerical interpretation.  Except for the requirement for uniqueness of
 * species/species type combinations located in compartments, simulators
 * and other numerical analysis software may ignore SpeciesType definitions
 * and references to them in a model.
 * 
 * There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
 * species types.  One SpeciesType object cannot be the subtype of another
 * SpeciesType object; SBML provides no means of defining such
 * relationships.
 * 
 * As with other major structures in SBML, SpeciesType has a mandatory
 * attribute, 'id', used to give the species type an identifier.  The
 * identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax
 * permitted in SBML.  SpeciesType also has an optional 'name' attribute,
 * of type @c string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used according to the
 * guidelines described in the SBML specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in
 * the Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification).
 *
 * SpeciesType was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
 * available in SBML Level&nbsp;1 nor in Level&nbsp;3.

 * The identifier given by an object's 'id' attribute value

 * question.  All data types are defined as follows:
 * <pre style='margin-left: 2em; border: none; font-weight: bold; color: black'>
 *   letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
 *   digit  ::= '0'..'9'
 *   idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
 *   SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*
 * </pre>
 *
 * The characters <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are used for grouping, the
 * character <code>*</code> 'zero or more times', and the character
 * <code>|</code> indicates logical 'or'.  The equality of SBML identifiers is
 * determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e., comparisons must be
 * performed in a case-sensitive manner.  This applies to all uses of <code>SId</code>, 
 * <code>SIdRef</code>, and derived types.
 *
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, the 'id' and 'name' attributes were
 * moved to SBase directly, instead of being defined individually for many
 * (but not all) objects.  Libsbml has for a long time provided functions
 * defined on SBase itself to get, set, check, and unset those attributes, which 
 * would fail or otherwise return empty strings if executed on any object 
 * for which those attributes were not defined.  Now that all SBase objects 
 * define those attributes, those functions now succeed for any object with 
 * the appropriate level and version.
 *
 * The exception to this rule is that for InitialAssignment, EventAssignment, 
 * AssignmentRule, and RateRule objects, the getId() function and the isSetId() 
 * functions (though not the setId() or unsetId() functions) would instead 
 * reference the value of the 'variable' attribute (for the rules and event 
 * assignments) or the 'symbol' attribute (for initial assignments).  
 * The AlgebraicRule fell into this category as well, though because it 
 * contained neither a 'variable' nor a 'symbol' attribute, getId() would 
 * always return an empty string, and isSetId() would always return @c false.
 * For this reason, four new functions are now provided 
 * (getIdAttribute(), setIdAttribute(@if java String@endif),

 *
 * The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a

 * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a

 * 'name'.)

 * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
 * generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
 * may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
 * take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)

 *
 * The 'name' attribute is
 * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
 * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
 * label for the component.  The data type of 'name' is the type
 * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
 * restrictions as to the content of 'name' attributes beyond those
 * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
 *
 * The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
 * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
 * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
 * component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
 * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
 * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the 'name'
 * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
 * should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
 * language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
 * 'name'.)
 * 
 * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
 * generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
 * may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
 * take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
 * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
 * meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
 * form of the name attribute value.
 * 
 * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'id' values, there are no
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This
 * allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.
 *
 * Regardless of the level and version of the SBML, these functions allow
 * client applications to use more generalized code in some situations 
 * (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have 
 * names).  If the object in question does not posess a 'name' attribute 
 * according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use,
 * libSBML will not allow the name to be set, nor will it read or 
 * write 'name' attributes for those objects.
